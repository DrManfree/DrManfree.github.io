# Maze-generator
Simple HTML page with a random maze generator.<br>
The maze generated is a true maze, meaning there are no loops and only one path from one point of the maze to another.<br>
<hr>
Change the height and width of the maze (max. 100) to your liking and press Generate.<br>
Choose an entry and an exit point in the maze and generate the shortest (and also the only) path.
